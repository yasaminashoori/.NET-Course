Abstraction helps to keep safe our classes.
Abstracts have 2 levels : 1-Abstract class 2-Abstract Methods in this episode.

 we'll talk about abstract class now  : 

// we cant make objects from abstract classes => var Vehicle1 = new Vehicle();  

and also we can define the last child class : 

// WE cant make child from sealed classes

        // class BusElectric : Bus
        // {
        //     int numbers;
        // }
