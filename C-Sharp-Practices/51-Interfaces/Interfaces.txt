Overviw : 
1- Interfaces same as abstract classes doesn't allow to instantiate an object from.

2- Interfaces don't have body and Implementation was in the derived class.

3- By dafault all of the Interfaces are abstract and public although we don't add them.

4- just Method and property are in the Interfaces (not field / variable)

5- All of the component of Interfaces should Implement in derived classes unless we'll get errors.

6- Interfaces don't allow to make constructor (abstract and no object).

7- Interface name starts with I like Iprey.
